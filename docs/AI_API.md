# POCKET AI API — sellable headless agents

**Product:** multi-agent AI API that runs on the operator host (or your deployment).  
**Meter:** POCK credits + API keys (`sk_pocket_…`).  
**UI optional:** desk is for humans; API is for apps and automation.

## Sell motion

1. Deploy POCKET with named tunnel / your domain.  
2. Issue API keys per customer.  
3. Bill subscription seat + overage from POCK burns (`GET /v1/ai/usage`).  
4. Map refill to NEXUS/POCKET subscription.
